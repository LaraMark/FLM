import pandas as pd  # Importing the pandas library to work with dataframes

# Load the sales data from a CSV file into a pandas dataframe
sales_data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Calculate the total sales for each product and store the result in a new dataframe column
sales_data["total_sales"] = sales_data["price"] * sales_data["quantity"]

# Group the data by product and calculate the average total sales
average_sales = sales_data.groupby("product")["total_sales"].mean()

# Print the average sales for each product
