# This line of code defines a variable called 'color' and assigns it the value 'flower'.
# The '__' on either side of the variable name indicate that it is a special attribute in Python.
# In this case, the '__' indicate that the variable is a magic method, which are special methods with double underscores on either side.
# Magic methods are used to add "magic" to classes, such as enabling objects to behave like numbers or strings.
# However, in this case, the '__color__' variable is not being used as a magic method, but rather as a regular variable.
# It is unclear what the 'flower' value represents in this context.
